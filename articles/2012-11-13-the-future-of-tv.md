The guys over at The Verge have started a new series covering the innovations (or lack therof) happening to broadcast Television dubbed "Over The Top". In the first piece Nilay Patel touches on one aspect of traditional TV we miss in our house after cutting the cord:

> Using an Apple TV or an Xbox 360 is an endless exercise in decision making that feels like you're constantly gambling with your time: if you'd just flipped on HBO you would have been 50 minutes into Transformers 2 by now, but instead you've watched 15 movie trailers, your wife hates you, and it's almost midnight.

This scenario plays out several nights every week at our house. Sometimes we miss simply turning on the TV and watching whatever happens to be on.

**Note**: As the name of the series suggests, the video included with this article is decidedly over the top.
