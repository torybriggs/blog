Shawn Blanc on the myth of creativity and schedules:

> One big myth about creativity is that it cannot be harnessed. It is silly to believe that a creative person should live without routine or accountability or discipline.

I think some structure is good in any type of profession. Benjamin Franklin also had a nice list of [13 virtues to live by](http://www.listsofnote.com/2012/03/franklins-13-virtues.html "Benjamin's 13 virtues to live by").
