Vox Media has rolled out a stunning update to one of my favorite sports sites. This particular article looks great and it is reminiscent of what we've been seeing from sister site [The Verge](http://theverge.com). It looks like they are using Hoefler & Frere-Jones web fonts: Ziggurat for headlines, Sentinal for introductions and Mercury for the body.

I'm excited to see what Vox has in store for [Polygon](http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/8/21/3245100/polygon-press-reset-teaser-trailer).
