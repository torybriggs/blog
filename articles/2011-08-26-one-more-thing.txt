M.G. Siegler:

> I truly believe that passion, while unseen, also translates. It’s like when you meet a good kid and you just know that he has good parents. We appreciate Jobs because he has been such a good parent of these products.

> He’s a good father in the same way that Walt Disney and Jim Henson were good fathers. Both of those men instilled passion and emotion in people through their products as well.

This piece from M.G. is perhaps my favorite from the tech media firestorm that followed Steve's resignation.
