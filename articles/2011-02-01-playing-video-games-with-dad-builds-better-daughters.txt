As a father of two girls this [study by Brigham Young University (pdf)](http://jahonline.org/webfiles/images/journals/jah/feature3.pdf) brought a large smile to my face. Mike Fahey of Kotaku reporting on the study:

>Researchers found that girls that played video games with their parents (mainly their fathers - not many mothers questioned admitted they played video games) were better behaved, felt more connected to their families, felt less aggressive, and demonstrated decreased levels of internalizing, which can lead to depression.

How awesome is that? My daughters aren't quite old enough for videogames, but when they are I plan on gaming with them often. Seems like the perfect activity to spend time chatting about life, school and 1up's :) According to the study these conversations are what make videogames worthwhile:

>When parents play video games with their daughters, they may be sending a myriad of messages. First, parents may show that they are willing to engage in an activity that is important to daughters. Second, playing video games can represent quality time between a daughter and a parent, especially when such play involves conversation between parentâ€“child.
