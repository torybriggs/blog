Andy Baio writing for wired:

> Against my better judgement, I sat in a conference room with my co-founders and a couple of patent attorneys and told them what we’d created. They took notes and created nonsensical documents that I still can’t make sense of. In all, I helped Yahoo file eight patent applications.

> Years after I left I discovered to my dismay that four of them were granted by the U.S. Patent and Trade Office.

> I thought I was giving them a shield, but turns out I gave them a missile with my name permanently engraved on it.
