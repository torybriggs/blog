The New Yorker has a great (and lengthy) piece profiling Guillermo del Toro:

>Del Toro was a playfully morbid child. One of his first toys, which he still owns, was a plush werewolf that he sewed together with the help of a great-aunt. In a tape recording made when he was five, he can be heard requesting a Christmas present of a mandrake root, for the purpose of black magic. His mother, Guadalupe, an amateur poet who read tarot cards, was charmed; his father, Federico, a businessman whom del Toro describes, fondly, as “the most unimaginative person on earth,” was confounded. Confounding his father became a lifelong project.

del Toro is an eccentric and fascinating person. This profile describes an uncompromising man who is absolutely in love with his craft. Recently, del Toro had been signed on to create "The Hobbit", a prequel to the 'L.O.T.R' trilogy. After spending two years of his life in Wellington, New Zealand working on the feature he was abruptly forced off of the project. Although it was not easy, Guillermo maintains that he left the project of his own accord. Commenting on the most difficult part of the departure:

>The most difficult part, he said, was “making peace with the fact that somebody else is going to have control of *your* creatures, *your* wardrobe, and change it, or discard it, or use it. All options are equally painful.” He added, “The stuff I left behind is absolutely gorgeous. I’m absolutely in love with it.”

It's a shame we may never see some of the amazing things del Toro had in store for "The Hobbit." Perhaps some of it will be included in the dozens of "special edition" releases that are sure to follow.
