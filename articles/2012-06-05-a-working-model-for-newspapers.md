Kyle Baxter:

> The Times, though, is still heavily targeted at a mass audience. They want regular readers to subscribe, and those subscriptions are very expensive. I believe this is a tremendous opportunity they’re missing. The Times has incredibly gifted journalists and resources, so there’s no reason they couldn’t make a “Times Politics” sub-publication and charge subscriptions for it. They have the talent and resources to turn something like that into a daily must-read for people in Washington and people obsessed with politics.
