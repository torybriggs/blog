I decided to test out <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> development on an old domain I had lying around.  After stumbling upon
<a href="http://cloudhead.io/toto">toto</a> I decided to give it a shot.  Toto uses simple .txt files
for writing out blog posts which fits my style quite well.  Once the articles are written, Git is utilized for
pushing content to the server.  The experience has been enjoyable so far and I look forward to utilizing
Heroku for other personal projects.
