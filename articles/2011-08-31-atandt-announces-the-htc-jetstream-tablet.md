> Look for it starting September 4th nationwide, but it won’t be cheap: AT&T’s charging $699.99 on a new two-year contract.

$699.99? Really? No details on storage were given, but this seems like a tough sale if it offers anything less than 32GB. Perhaps there is a cheaper Wi-Fi only version in the works.
