Kyle describes a friend he lost in July who served as an inspiration to him. His wristband is a reminder to appreciate the wonderful people in his life and make the most of his time on Earth.

This post really struck a chord with me. I wear a black wristband (but sometimes pink or purple) to show support for our 2-year daughter who was [diagnosed with Leukemia](http://brionni.org "Brionni.org") last May. Every time I glance down at it and see my daughter's name, I am reminded of the uncertainty of her future. We are confident she will recover from her cancer but it's a daily reminder of how fragile things can be.

Although trials and tragedy will befall all of us, these little reminders help us excel and accomplish great things. Kyle, thank you for this post. Sometimes, we need inspiration to get through the difficult times.
