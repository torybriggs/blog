Kyle wears a green wristband everyday to remind himself of the wonderful people in his life and the limited time we have on Earth. He also wears it because a friend of his passed away this July.

This post really struck a chord with me. I also wear a wristband (black, purple or pink depending on the day) to show support for my [2-year old daughter](http://brionni.org) who was diagnosed with Leukemia this May. Every time I glance down and read her name I am reminded of the uncertainty of her future. We are very confident that she will overcome this trial, but sometimes we need to be reminded of the fragility of this life. Kyle's writing reminds me that I should always make the most of my valuable and limited time. 

Thanks Kyle.
