Chris Ziegler writing for The Verge:

> For one, no two carriers have the same supply — spectrum, that is — nor do they have the ability to readily generate more supply. Secondly, those carriers often have a vested interest in obscuring just how close they are to exhausting their existing supply for a variety of competitive reasons, and it's virtually impossible to get an accurate read on it from the outside. Third, hardware exclusives and contracts are always being used as a tool to limit carriers' need to compete on plan pricing alone — if you have the better hardware and your customers know it, why bother to undercut (or even match) the competition?

Chris asserts the fight for unlimited data is a non-starter since the amount of availabe spectrum is a limited resource. He presents a number of effective fronts on which consumers could fight the wireless carriers, but after reading the article I'm a bit depressed on the entire market as a whole. It's sad that the consumer market with arguable the greatest advances in technology is one controlled by a few monolithic companies.
