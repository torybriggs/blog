>There is writing, and then there is **Writing**. And I am amazed at how often I will shy away from the former because it doesnâ€™t feel like the latter. There are times when I put far too much emphasis on the fine-tuned components of writing, and not nearly enough emphasis on simply getting the words down.

This is why I love to read [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net). Articles like these, where he beautifully puts his thoughts to words, creates a personal connection with the reader. It is easy to visualize the intent of his work and this piece is something I can relate to. Writing does not come easy for me, but an article like this is inspiring and helps me put the hands back on the keyboard.
