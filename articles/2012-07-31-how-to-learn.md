> I know a lot of people that try to understand everything about iOS, Rails, or whatever they're trying to learn. This is stupid. If you actually tried to understand it all, you'd spend years before even coming close. Just look at a simple request of the Internet. If you even got as far as TCP, I'd be impressed. If you did, TCP is mind blowing topic on it's own. (The nerdy part is over, carry on.)
