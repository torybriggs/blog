[Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/about), the mastermind behind Instapaper has decided to release a full API for developers. In his post he describes how reluctant he was to release an official API due to operational costs. If a complete API was released, developer's could conceivable build a competing app and reduce the userbase of the official app.

But Marco has a brilliant twist with his API:
>**Full API access, but only for paid-subscriber accounts**. In other words, all developers can use the Full API, but it will only work for customers with Instapaperâ€™s $1/month [Subscription](http://www.instapaper.com/subscription) memberships.

Genius. Now instead of either limiting the API or charging developer's for access, he can simply charge the existing (and paltry) fee of $1/month.
