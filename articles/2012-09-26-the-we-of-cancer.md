  We were obviously devastated when we received the news our daughter had cancer. We were also extremely humbled by the outpouring of support from local and online communities. Cancer is terrible but there are many organizations that are helping in the fight. Stephen now has a prominent link to [St. Jude](http://www.stjude.org/stjude/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=f87d4c2a71fca210VgnVCM1000001e0215acRCRD "St. Jude") at the top of his site. Might I also suggest [Make a Wish](http://wish.org/ "Make A Wish")? They don't fight cancer directly, but they help kids enjoy life while they battle the disease. Our daughter was recently granted a wish and it was pretty magical.
