Amidst the current recession are stories of bright young minds becoming entrepreneurial sensations overnight. And thanks to the wonder of modern communication, these stories spread like wildfire throughout college campuses across America. Perhaps a question many young minds forget to ask themselves before creating a new venture is: Why?

Jeffrey Bussgang addresses this question in his article on the [Harvard Business Review](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/01/should_i_become_an_entrepreneu.html):

>In the earliest stages of a venture - the jungle - there are no clear paths available and the skills required are to thrive in the midst of the chaos. For those who possess that makeup, being a start-up executive is an excellent fit. But for those that like clear paths with little uncertainty and a great deal of structure - the highway - an early-stage venture will feel like a very uncomfortable environment.

This is a something everyone thinking about starting a business should assess for themselves. There is comfort in the structured 9 to 5 workday typical of a job in corporate America. And the demands of a startup CEO are akin to the analogy in Jeffrey's article. It's a jungle out there, but it's hard not to look at the successes of companies like Facebook, Twitter, Groupon or 37Signals and wonder if it would be possible to accomplish myself.

[Obsession Times Voice](http://daringfireball.net/2009/03/obsession_times_voice) from Jon Gruber is an article I read nearly every week. It inspires me as I strive to make this blog (and anything for that matter) great. I suggest you read it, and then consider whether determination and obsession are the key ingredients to overcoming the entrepreneurial wilderness.
