Joshua Topolsky has written a great editorial on the likely outcomes of the Google/Motorola acquisition. He outlines three possible scenarios:

1. Google really only wants the patents

> Keeping middle managers and engineers away from one another when they’re working on parallel projects will practically be a business unto itself, but Google will do it because it has to. Right? So Motorola hobbles along as an autonomous, barely-profitable hardware business, and Google eats the costs because… well, it can.

Not likely. I understand Google conducts business a bit differently than most tech companies because it's source of income is different, but spending $12.5 billion for an *asset* only to watch it hobble and struggle from afar seems like bad business sense.


2. Larry Page wants to be Steve Jobs

> Sure, companies like Apple and Palm couldn’t pull off the role as OEM and licensor — but Google is a different company and we’re living in a different world. Right?

Again, highly unlikely. There has been a terrible track record for companies that try to play the role of OEM and licensor. Isn't that what almost [killed Apple](http://books.google.com/books?id=mXnw5tM8QRwC&lpg=PA245&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false "Google Books") before Steve made his return?

3. Google is strip mining

> The only choice Google would have if it didn’t want to own or operate a hardware company would be to pick apart the most appealing pieces of Motorola’s business and sell them to the highest bidder — likely after cutting a healthy amount of the nearly 20,000 employees on the company’s payroll.

This seems like the most likely outcome. It's hard to predict what will happen, but why does Google need to prop up a [struggling](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=motorola+mobility "Wolfram Alpha") hardware maker? They could simply hold onto the patents and strip out the best assets from the company (hardware engineers) and jettison the rest.

No matter the direction Google chooses to turn, this marks an important point in the history of the mobile business.
