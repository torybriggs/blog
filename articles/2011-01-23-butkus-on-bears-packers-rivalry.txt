>During practice at Wrigley Field during one of Butkus’ early years, the linebacker recalled a Packer-Bear scare of spying. “During practice we’re all standing around on the sidelines while the offense was working,” Butkus said. Then all of a sudden the coach was approached. “”Coach coach!’ and he says ‘Yeah yeah, what what!?’ ‘I don’t want to say nothing but if you look up there across the street on Waveland Ave, one of those apartments there seems to be a reflection of a camera.’” Then the coach sent security up to check out everyone staying in the building and get the windows closed.

It's hard to say if this stuff currently happens in the league. Regardless, we're in for a good game today.
