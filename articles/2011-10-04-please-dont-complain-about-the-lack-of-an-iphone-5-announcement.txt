After the [iPhone 4S](http://www.apple.com/iphone/#video-4s) announcement, Twitter was ablaze with people complaining about a lack of an iPhone 5 release. But why?

Apple is following a now established release pattern (3G, 3GS, 4, 4S etc..) and the iPhone 4S essentially fulfills all the iPhone 5 "requirements" minus a bigger screen and new enclosure. Personally, I'll take the smaller screen and greater pixel density over a larger screen at a lower resolution. [NFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication) is something that could have been added, but Apple is smart enough to know that it isn't mature enough to include in the iPhone.

The features they did include, however, look awesome. An amazing still/video camera, mind-blowing voice commands, increased battery life, the A5 chip and finally a single SKU for both CDMA and GSM.

What did everyone expect? Just imagine the 4S is actually a 5 and you'll be much happier.
