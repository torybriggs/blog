There is no denying Steve Jobs is a visionary.  There is also no denying that Tim Cook is a brilliant operational manager. I think the combination of the two is the secret sauce behind Apple's success.  From the New York Times:

>Take the iPad. It took Mr. Jobs’s imagination and the expertise of his engineers and designers to create it. But Mr. Cook’s operational abilities allowed Apple to parlay a cool product into a business that has already brought in $9.6 billion, as the company built and shipped worldwide nearly 15 million iPads in just nine months to meet customers’ seemingly insatiable appetite.

Apple has a deep bench from which to draw from for a replacement to Steve Jobs, but who has the visionary prowess to complement the managerial expertise of Cook? Only time will tell.
