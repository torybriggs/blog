Zach Baron of Grantland waxes poetic about the *Alien* franchise:

> It's striking, watching Prometheus, to think about the franchise from which it springs, and to which it is eerily loyal, despite the arterial spray of competing concerns and ideas brought to the series over the years by Scott, James Cameron, David Fincher, and Jean-Pierre Jeunet, a murderer's row of pop directorial talent, all of whom made some of their weirdest and most revealing work for what has essentially been one long, bloody B movie. It makes you wonder if there's been a better, or at least more consistently fascinating, franchise in the past 30 years.
