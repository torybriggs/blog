There has been much hoo-hawing about the [rejection](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/technology/02apple.html) of Sony's e-book app. But is it all warranted? The rejection may have stemmed from any number of things that Apple hasn't publicly commented on. The only official statement regarding the matter comes courtesy of Trudy Muller:

>We have not changed our developer terms or guidelines. We are now requiring that if an app offers customers the ability to purchase books outside of the app, that the same option is also available to customers from within the app with in-app purchase.

Taking that statement at face value could spell trouble for book publishers on iOS. With margins as thin as they are any cut from Apple could push publishers away from the platform. The way I see it there are two scenarios: either in-app book prices will go up or Apple reduces/eliminates it's cut of the sale. As [Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/02/01/dovey-in-app-purchasing) noted, something has to give.

When I first considered these options I thought it unlikely Apple would budge on the 30% cut. It is possible, however, that Apple simply wants every iOS app to be on the same playing field as it's web app counterpart. Requiring the massive online catalogs (of Sony, Amazon, Barnes and Noble etc..) to be available through in-app purchase greatly enhances usability. A customer would *never* have to leave the app to make a purchase. But is a more seamless experience worth a 30% sacrifice of all book profits?

My guess clarification might come as early as tomorrow during Rupert Murdoch's announcement of [The Daily](http://rdd.me/4v0ubzz3). That announcement will feature an appearance from Apple vice president of Interent services Eddy Cue, who will be explaining a new iTunes subscription model.

At any rate, these are the facts:

1. Currently, Apple has only said it will be enforcing in-app "book" purchases. This potentialy excludes other apps such as Ebay.
2. There has been no comment regarding a change in Apple's 30% cut.
3. Nearly every rejection of a high profile app creates controversy.



There are still a great number of unknowns about the future state of in-app purchases on iOS.
