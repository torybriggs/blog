A very well-made video of Miguel Endara drawing a portrait of his dad using a [Pigma Micron 005 pen](http://www.shopatron.com/products/category/Micron+005+size+/+.20+mm+nib/294.0.1.1.8816.9956.8787.0.0). You won't find a single pen stroke in this drawing, instead Miguel uses over 3 million dots to make his work of art.
