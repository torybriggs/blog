Fascinating article about Francis Ford Coppola and his directing, writing and producing style. He describes how he prepared the actors before filming "The Godfather." Apparently everyone was intimidated and scared of Marlon Brando. Coppola found a way to use that intimidation to his advantage:

>I said, “I want you to come and be hungry.” And they came to a restaurant that I had arranged, the back room of the restaurant, just a table that looked like a home. Marlon, I had sit at the head of the table, and to his right I put Al Pacino, and to his left I put Jimmy Caan. I put Bobby Duvall, and I put Johnny Cazale, and I had my sister Talia, who played Connie, serve the food. 

>They had a dinner improvisation together, and after awhile everyone is relating to Marlon as the father, and Jimmy Caan is trying to impress him with jokes, and Al Pacino is trying to impress him by being intense and quiet, and my sister was so frightened – she was serving the food. And after that dinner they were the characters.

There are a dozen other such gems in the interview. A must read.
