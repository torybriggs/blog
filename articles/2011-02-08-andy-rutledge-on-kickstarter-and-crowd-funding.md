Andy presents a scathing critique of [Frank Chimero's](http://work.frankchimero.com/) recent [experiment](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/30453381/the-shape-of-design) on [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/):

>So armed with the misguided notion that others already fully or partially own your genius and property you’re apt to make mistakes in commerce; like inviting a crowd to determine the proper dissemination of it. The colloquial term for this is “selling out.”

Ouch.

Mr. Rutledge contends that any investment taken from a collective represents a purchase of genius from the investors. In essence, the creator has sold his product and genius before a product has been conceived. This may be true in a conventional VC or angel investment, but not with Kickstarter. Perhaps Andy forgot to read the [FAQ](http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq#DoesKickTakeSomePercOfOwneOrIntePropOfThinMadeThroKick) because it clearly states any creator will maintain *100% ownership of their work*. Yes, the creator is required to offer the backers a "reward," but in most cases that is simply delivering the project.

Most of Andy's critique is unwarranted in the context of Kickstarter and Mr. Chimero's project.
