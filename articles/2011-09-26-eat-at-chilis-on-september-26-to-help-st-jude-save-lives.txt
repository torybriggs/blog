>That “ability to pay” phrase is shockingly meaningful to families like ours. Josiah’s care has cost over $2 million to date, and thanks to that care, he is doing very well.

As a father of a 3-year old [daughter](http://brionni.org) with cancer, I understand how overwhelming these costs can be. Please consider eating at Chili's on September 26th (tonight) since [100% of it's profits will go to St. Jude](http://www.createapepper.com/BigDay.aspx).
