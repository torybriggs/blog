> Moleskine notebooks rank alongside the MacBook Pro, money and caffiene on our fictional list of ‘Most Beloved Freelancing Tools’. It’s a shame, then, that many Moleskine owners don’t realize the full potential of their little black book… much like many brain-owners don’t realize the full potential of their squishy salmon-colored companion.

I love my Moleskine notebook. My flavor of choice is the 5x8 grid journal. It's perfect for outlines, sketches and site layout ideas. This article recommends the [Pilot G-2](http://www.pilotpen.us/products/gel/#anchor_g2Pro "Pilot G-2") for writing, but I much prefer the [Sharpie Pen](http://pen.sharpie.com/ "Sharpie Pen").
