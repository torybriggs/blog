A selection of fine goods for that special geek in your life, including an item I recently purchased and enjoy:

> [Jawbone UP](http://jawbone.com/up/buy "Jawbone UP"): The latest addition to the trend of personal fitness tracking gadgets, the UP is meant to be worn 24/7 so it can track your movements during the day and your sleep patterns at night. And it’s smart enough to remind when you’ve been sitting at your desk for too long, as well as waking you in the morning during the ideal time in your sleep cycle. ($100)
