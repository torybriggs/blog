Amir Efrati for the Wall Street Journal:

> This summer, "Starcraft II" has become the newest barroom spectator sport. Fans organize so-called Barcraft events, taking over pubs and bistros from Honolulu to Florida and switching big-screen TV sets to Internet broadcasts of professional game matches happening often thousands of miles away.

As a big Starcraft II player/fan it's been amazing to watch the popularity of eSports rise. Blizzard has provided great tools for broadcasters and viewers. There has also been a big push from well-known websites such as [IGN](http://ign.com/ipl "IGN Pro League"), Justin.tv and their new site [Twitch.tv](http://twitch.tv "Twitch.tv") and my favorite [WellPlayed.org](http://wellplayed.org "WellPlayed.org").

Amir continues:

> In the U.S., fervor for "Starcraft II" is spilling into public view for the first time, as many players now prefer to watch the pros. In mid-July, during the first North American Star League tournament in Los Angeles, 85,000 online viewers watched Puma defeat MC in the live championship match on Twitch.tv, said Emmett Shear, who runs the recently-launched site.

Accumulating 85,000 viewers for an online-only live event is no small feat. My hope is that this movement continues to grow with the release of [Heart of the Swarm](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/game/heart-of-the-swarm-preview/ "Heart of the Swarm") and Valve's [DOTA 2](http://www.joystiq.com/2010/10/13/valve-announces-dota-2/ "DOTA 2").
