J. Eddie Smith, IV from Practically Efficient:

> To me, 4G is a lot like 1080p HD was in the mid to late 2000s. I knew people that paid huge premiums for 1080p over 720p when, in reality, all of the available HD content from cable and satellite providers was limited to 720pâ€”something that changed only recently.

Eddie's thoughts echo mine. Where I live, just outside of Denver, I would be walking in and out of 4G coverage daily. I know this would have a dramatic impact on battery life. 4G is the future, but what carriers offer now, is not. The coverage is limited and the chipsets are still immature. Besides, no one is offering [real 4G](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G#Requirements "4G on Wikipedia") anyway.

Just like Eddie, I think a powerful and fast camera is much more important (I have two litte daughters).
