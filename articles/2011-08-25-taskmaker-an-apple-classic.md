TaskMaker was one of my first experiences with an Apple computer. The game wasn't exactly great, but it definitely wasn't bad. I remember watching my cousins play it on my uncle's old [Power Macintosh G3](http://applemuseum.bott.org/sections/computers/G3.html "Power Macintosh G3"). Since they only had the shareware version, we ended up playing the same sections of the game over and over.

A brief text conversation with my cousin revealed that my uncle still has the G3, along with a small collection of other Macintosh hardware. Collections such as these are a tribute to the legacy of Steve Job's career. While Twitter was exploding with the news of Steve's resignation, I noticed the same feeling expressed over and over: "I can't think of a single person who has had a greater influence on my profession."

Most of my day is spent in front of a computer, so I echo this sentiment.
