>Think "cologne advertising agency figures that producing baseball cards might be fun," and you pretty much have the idea. And I'm not talking about Ralph Lauren, I'm talking about gas station cologne. You know, the stuff in the display, sitting on the counter next to the 5 Hour Energy, with dated beefcake on the front of the box.

My favorite is "Pondering" by Todd Worrell.
