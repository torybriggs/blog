> It’s not just that Isaacson was wrong about *something*; it’s that he was wrong about the most important thing in Jobs’s career. There’s a decades-long story arc about the software system started at NeXT that Isaacson completely misses.

Fantastic essay about the shortcomings of Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs.
