Nilay Patel writing for This is my next...:

> As a group, we have accepted and let lie the lazy conventional wisdom that the patent system is broken beyond repair, a relic of a previous time that has been obsoleted by the rapid pace of technical innovation, particularly in software, and that it should perhaps be scrapped altogether.

This is a fantastic editorial that gives the discussion of patent reform a logical base. Many in the tech community have been screaming for reform without understand the system itself. Nilay explains that the patent system is actually designed to promote innovation by releasing to the public the exact details of the patent how to recreate it (yes, even the Google PageRank algorithm). In exchange for publicly revealing their invention, the patent holder may hold a monopoly on the invention for several years. But what about patent trolls? Nilay compares patent holding companies to people who scoop up large chunks of real estate:

> What you would fault someone for is buying up tons of prime real estate in the center of town and setting up a strip mine — it’s an offensive and exploitative use of property that maximizes individual profit at a huge expense to society.

I think this is one of the fundamental problems of the patent system. This is clearly what we should be talking about when we discuss reform. At any rate, Nilay's editorial is fascinating and greatly contributes the current debate.
