Will Smith from Tested with the first sane response to the iPhone 4S announcement:

> If you’re still upset that this year’s iPhone didn’t get a cosmetic redesign or a bigger screen, don’t worry. As the smartphone market continues to mature, the number of actual enhancements and additions manufacturers can make will continue to decline. To keep demand high, manufacturers will be forced to do more frequent cosmetic redesigns. Eventually, we’ll cross a kind of smartphone singularity, where the hardware and software all does exactly the same thing and the only differences between products are cosmetic. If you want to see what that looks like, check out the PC aisle at your Best Buy.

This is a sad but true fact. Apple has been able to advance phone technology by leaps and bounds the last few years, but it is inevitable that these advancements will slow down in lieu of the next handset revolution.

Any bets on who is likely to lead that revolution?
