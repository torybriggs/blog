In a 7-2 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to defend the Constitutional rights of games. Court Justice Scalia wrote the opinion:
>Video games qualify for First Amendment protection. Like protected books, plays, and movies, they communicate ideas through familiar literary devices and features distinctive to the medium. And the basic principles of freedom of speech...do not vary with a new and different communication medium.

In a rare show of support, Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan agreed with Scalia.

**Update:** I couldn't help but include this choice nugget from Justice Scalia:

>Reading Dante is unquestionably more cultured and intellectually edifying than playing Mortal Kombat," reads one of the footnotes in the majority opinion. "But these cultural and intellectual differences are not constitutional ones. Crudely violent video games, tawdry TV shows, and cheap novels and magazines are no less forms of speech than The Divine Comedy, and restrictions upon them must survive strict scrutiny.
