I recently purchased a refurbished 15" Macbook Pro. The model I chose had an i7 processor running at 2.2 GHz with the upgraded AMD Radeon HD 6750M GPU. As far as the CPU and GPU, this machine had similar specs as the MPB [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2011/09/07/the-new-setup "Marco's new setup") recently purchased. Yesterday Marco [wrote](http://www.marco.org/2011/09/20/heat-and-fan-issues-with-2011-15-inch-macbook-pro "Heat and fan issues") about the heat and fan-noise issues he had been experiencing. His post is quite detailed about the problems he has observed and the likely reasons they appear. I, however, haven't experience any of these issues.

I typically have about 10 apps open at any given time as well as 15-20 tabs open in Safari (and more recently Chrome). These apps include BBEdit, Twitter, Rdio, Quicktime, Reeder, nvALT and occasionally Photoshop. According to iStats and smcFanControl my CPU almost always stays between 60-65C. And the fans rarely spin above 2500rpm, even when I'm streaming music from Rdio and watching videos via Quicktime.

Of course both of these experiences are purely anecdotal and don't necessarily reflect the experiences of the majority of users. After reading Marco's post I was worried there were manufacturing issues with the laptop I intend to use for the next 3-5 years. This was disconcerting so I went to Google for some answers. What I found mirrored Marco's experience. There are quite a few threads on the Apple support forums about heat and fan-issues. Many of them mention [too much thermal paste](https://discussions.apple.com/message/13140299#13140299 "Too much thermal paste on Apple support forums") being used on the CPU as well as not enough ventilation.

My assumption is that there have been multiple manufacturing revisions for this model and Marco was stuck with the bugs of the initial run. He also [mentioned on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/marcoarment/status/109364431300984832 "SATA talk on Twitter") that his particular laptop didn't come with the newer SATA III superdrive bay either. Mine [did](http://d.pr/MeNB "Screenshot of the newer SATA III").

I think a lot of these heat/fan issues were resolved after the initial manufacturing run, but anyone considering a refurb purchase should be aware of the potential problems.
