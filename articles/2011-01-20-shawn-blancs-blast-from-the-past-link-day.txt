This is fantastic.  Shawn is hosting a list of old, worthwhile articles we should all read.  Entries are submitted with the hashtag [#pastblast](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23pastblast).  The link will take you to his post explaining the event but you'll want to check his [home page](http://shawnblanc.net/) to see the new posts roll in.
