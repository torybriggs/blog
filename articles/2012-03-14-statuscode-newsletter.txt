Many of your are no doubt aware of [tthor](http://tthor.com 'tthor newsletter'), a newsletter I publish weekly about design, development, technology and other geekery. [Peter Cooper](http://peterc.org/ "Peter Cooper") and his myriad of [web publications](https://cooperpress.com/ "Cooper Press") was a contributing inspiration for launching tthor. He recently launched [StatusCode](http://statuscode.org/ "StatusCode Newsletter"), and I have found it to be a great development resource.
