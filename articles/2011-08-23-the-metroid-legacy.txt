Jeremy Parish:

> Samus' most entertaining abilities were her most unconventional ones. The aforementioned Screw Attack turned her entire body into a weapon. The Ice Beam disregarded physics to freeze enemies both figuratively and literally: A single blast would both halt an enemy in its tracks and physically coat it with ice, rendering it a harmless stepping stone for Samus. And then there was the Maru-Mari, later renamed the Morph Ball, which allowed Samus to ignore basic rules of anatomy by converting herself into a sphere that could roll through low areas while planting explosives. It was a strange concept, but it served the ultimate purpose of making a fun game.
