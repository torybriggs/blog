Question and answer with Richard Ziade about Readability:

> __Q__: Your [support documents](http://help.readability.com/customer/portal/articles/267033-what-does-premium-have-that-free-doesn%E2%80%99t-) state that “premium supports the costs to run the service, continued development” and paying publishers. If all of your customers go with a free account, how does Readability intend to make money?

> __A__: We’re still navigating towards a plan in that respect. Right now, we just want to build a big and engaged community.
