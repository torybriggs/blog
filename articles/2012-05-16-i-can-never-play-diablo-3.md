David Hinckle of Joystiq gives a deeply personal testimonial about his addiction to Diablo:

> In retrospect, the low point was probably the morning of 9/11. I never admitted this to anybody because it was only Chuck and myself in the room, but the morning it happened, I played Diablo 2. As Chuck was horrified of what was being shown on the TV, I was in the Bloody Foothills trying to gain a few levels for an assassin build I was working on. Chuck called DCCC to see if we had class and, after hearing we did not, I played Diablo 2 all day until his parents came home from work. I ate dinner with them and then I went back to Diablo 2.
