A great piece by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/#!/mdo), co-creator of Twitter Bootstrap, writing for A List Apart:

> Together, our process for each new feature or design component matured to **ideation, debate and feature review, implementation, and lastly abstraction and documentation**. It made the development of our internal tools rather smooth, helped us avoid feature creep and code bloat, and helped us to document not only how to use a component but *why* you should use that *particular* component in Bootstrap.
