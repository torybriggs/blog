I recently stumbled upon this amazing site by Matt Kohr. I've always been a (terrible) doodler. An unrealized goal I've had for a long time is to formally take up digital illustration and painting. Matt has put together some extremely high quality instructional videos and released them for free on his site. Some topics he covers include drawing, painting, textures and theory. They have been extremely helpful for someone who is relatively new to the world of illustration and painting, but I imagine there are some concepts covered that anyone would find useful.
