title: No Skyrim For The Windows Store
date: 16/10/2012

> But there's just one problem. Microsoft has decided not to make the new Windows 8 ecosystem follow the same rules as traditional Windows. Unlike the transition from MS-DOS to Windows 3.0, Microsoft isn't planning to expand the Windows ecosystem. They are planning to bifurcate it.

According to Microsoft's [certification rules](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh694083.aspx) any game containing "mature" content won't be certified for the store. That means [PC Gamer's 2011 game of the year](http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/01/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-pc-gamers-game-of-the-year/) would never exist in Microsoft's new store.

This is perhaps one reason why there has been [such](http://allthingsd.com/20120725/valves-gabe-newell-on-the-future-of-games-wearable-computers-windows-8-and-more/) [resistance](https://twitter.com/Rob_Pardo/status/228235190705729536) from the gaming industry to Windows 8.
