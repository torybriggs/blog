Hopefully we'll all be able to get a piece of the action soon:

> Here at kottke.org, we've invested in a couple of "start up" companies and thought it was time to disclose that information. We're happy to announce that we've participated in a friends-and-family angel series-Î± round for [Vooza](http://vooza.com/ "Vooza"), a "mobile web app that's realtime, cloud-based, social, and local." Joining us are several other great investors like Tim Conway, Paul Grayjoy, Mark Anderrssonn, Freddy Dubs, Denim Roberts, Katrina Faux, and Petrus T. Heel.

I've [had my eye](https://twitter.com/torybriggs/status/210094909204611072) on Vooza for a few days now.
