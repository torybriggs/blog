When Kara Swisher at All Things D wrote that Apple ["sort of"](http://allthingsd.com/20111004/i-am-number-4s-no-sparkly-iphone-5-disappoints-apple-fans-and-wall-street/ "Kara Swisher sort of") rolled out a new iPhone, the Macalope responded:

> Um, nooo, it really did. What it didnâ€™t do is update the form factor to the rumored teardrop shape, causing pundits to cry real teardrops.

She's not the only one hilariously skewered in this post.
