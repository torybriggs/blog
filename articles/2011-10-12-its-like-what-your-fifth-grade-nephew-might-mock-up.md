[Steve Yegge](https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts), a "high-profile" Google engineer mistakenly posted an opinionated rant about the state of their services. According to a [post](https://plus.google.com/110981030061712822816/posts/bwJ7kAELRnf) from his Google+ account, the mistake occurred because he *couldn't figure out* how to post something privately. He meant it to be an internal post to fellow employees, but ended up sharing it with the world. Wow.

In his rant Steve compares Google's current services and API's to that of Amazon and Microsoft:

> After you’ve marveled at the platform offerings of Microsoft and Amazon, and Facebook I guess (I didn’t look because I didn’t want to get too depressed), head over to developers.google.com and browse a little. Pretty big difference, eh? It’s like what your fifth-grade nephew might mock up if he were doing an assignment to demonstrate what a big powerful platform company might be building if all they had, resource-wise, was one fifth grader.

Pretty strong words. Read the full transcript at the bottom of the linked post.
