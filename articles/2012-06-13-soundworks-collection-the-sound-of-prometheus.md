Whether you loved it or hated it, Prometheus has caused quite a discussion across the web. Personally, I enjoyed the film. Amidst the numerous plot holes, unanswered questions and ridiculous scenes, there was some great science fiction, visuals and a sense of dread and awe. One contributing factor to the great atmosphere of the movie was the sound design.
