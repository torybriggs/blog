There is no doubt a SOPA-esque bill will pass through Congress again in the near future. [Chris Dodd](http://www.mpaa.org/about/ceo) couldn't do enough damage while in Congress, ([his track record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Dodd#Countrywide_Financial_loan_controversy)) he now heads up the [MPAA](http://www.mpaa.org/about/ceo) in an effort to lobby the government to pass bills such as SOPA.
