A great piece by Nilay Patel detailing Vizio's foray into the PC market. Here is one choice nugget:

> Reducing clutter and increasing overall quality also meant fighting with Microsoft and Intel to keep the machines sticker-free. “I hate opening a PC and seeing stickers and flashing LEDs all over the place,” says McManigal. McRae was even more vehement: he spent hours arguing about the stickers, even putting together PowerPoints of forum posts and websites discussing the best ways to remove stickers from other Windows PCs. The fight paid off: Vizio's machines are totally clean apart from a small Windows emblem silkscreened on the bottom casing.

I'm surprised that existing PC manufacturers haven't fought to do the same. Here we have a relatively small company, with actual design sense, fighting to remove the ridiculous stickers included on every other PC. Kudos to them.
