This is one of the best articles I've read this month. Shawn advises on how to collect ideas and then how to sift the great ones from the good ones.

> My first reaction to a new idea is to write it down as soon as I can. Since the idea is still organic and fresh at first, itâ€™s important to jot it down in its purest form. Also, by writing the idea down it clears my mind to continue thinking about the idea some more and even exploring its grander scope.

This is an area in which I need to improve. Oftentimes when an idea occurs to me I assume I'll be able to remember it without writing it down. This is exactly how good ideas are lost. It's amazing how quickly an idea can fade away or become watered down over time. It's important to keep a tool for capturing ideas close by.

Another very important takeaway from Shawn's post:

> If all of the above seem viable, then I begin pitching it to some trusted friends in order to get their feedback.

This is an important step in the sifting process. It is the "puriifying fire" so to speak. Many ideas may seem great at first glance, by the helpful opinion from a trusted friend can save you a lot of pain and grief.

Shawn's entire piece is gold.
