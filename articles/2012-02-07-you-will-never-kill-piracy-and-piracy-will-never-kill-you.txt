Paul Tassi writing for Forbes:

> In terms of buying new films, studios are so far behind the times it’s laughable. Most often they want you to buy the $30 Blu-ray so you can get the “Ultraviolet” copy as well that plays on a few digital devices. Please, how about I’ll give you $10 for the new Harry Potter, and I’ll watch it whenever and wherever I want? This is a negotiation where at any time, your customer could just go download the damn movie for free, and they’re doing you a favor by even considering picking it up legally. And you have the nerve to think it’s on YOUR terms? That’s not how negotiation works. It may not be right, but it’s reality, and they have to face it.

Paul's main argument is for a [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/ "Steam")-like client for movies. There are downsides to this model, but in my opinion the benefits greatly outweigh them. There were many doubts about Steam when it was first introduced, but it has since become extremely popular and is my tool of choice for buying games.

The bottom line: Hollywood has to make their content easier to access than any illegal alternative with a pricing model that consumers can swallow. Legislation is not the answer.
