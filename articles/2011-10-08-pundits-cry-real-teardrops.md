When Kara Swisher at All Things D wrote that Apple ["sort of"](http://allthingsd.com/20111004/i-am-number-4s-no-sparkly-iphone-5-disappoints-apple-fans-and-wall-street/ "Kara Swisher sort of") rolled out a new iPhone, the Macalope responded:

> Um, nooo, it really did. What it didn’t do is update the form factor to the rumored teardrop shape, causing pundits to cry real teardrops.

She's not the only one hilariously skewered in this post. Here's one more choice nugget:

> To Hamilton Nolan, the punk at bottom-feeding “gossip” site Gawker, who claims to have never used an Apple product but feels no qualms about lecturing us on how ridiculous our mourning of Steve Jobs is: Maybe the people who make the products you use don’t mean anything to you because their products suck. Ever think of that? Or, another thought, maybe they don’t mean anything to you because you’re dead inside. Also worth considering.
