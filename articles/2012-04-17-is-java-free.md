Dan Farber reporting for cnet:

> Asked by Google's lead attorney, Robert Van Nest, if the Java language
is free, Ellison was slow to respond. Judge William Alsup pushed
Ellison to answer with a yes or no. As ZDNet reporter Rachel King
observed in the courtroom, Ellison resisted and huffed, "I don't know."

Just one of many reasons I would hesitate to build anything in Java.
