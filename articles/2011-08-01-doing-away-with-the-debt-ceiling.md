Bruce Bartlett, a former senior policy advisor in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and noted [Keynesian](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/business/07leonhardt.html), writing for The New York Times *Economix* blog:

>The negotiations leading up to Sunday nightâ€™s announcement that President Obama and Congressional leaders of both parties had reached a deal to cut trillions of dollars in federal spending over the next decade makes the case against the debt limit that much stronger. We now know that it is a powerful mechanism for political extortion.
