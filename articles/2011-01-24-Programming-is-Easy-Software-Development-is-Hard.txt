What is the distinction between "Programming" and "Software Development"?  Krishna makes his distinction in his article:

>Programming is solving a well-defined problem. Software development is defining the problem in the first place.

I think this distinction is accurate, although programming does not come easily to everyone. To be proficient I have to constantly work at programming. In college I remember my professors telling me over and over that learning the semantics of a given programming language wasn't important, rather it was understanding the problem and designing a smart solution. The implementation of the solution was irrelevant; Anyone can teach themselves a programming language through repetition and documentation. This didn't always make sense to me as I struggled with [inheritance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming\)) and [polymorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming). The most important thing, I was told, was to learn how to identify the problem and design a solution.
