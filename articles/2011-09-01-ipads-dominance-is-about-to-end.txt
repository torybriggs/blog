Jason Raznick writing for Forbes about the impending Amazon tablet:

> One gives the hardware away for practically nothing to have you buy its products and consumer [sic] its software. The other tries to get the highest margins possible out of everything it sells.

Amazon is probably the only company that could sell a tablet at a slight loss and make it work. They can make up any losses through software and consumer goods sales. But that last sentence is striking; Apple try to make money on *everything* it sells. Isn't that what everyone should be doing?

This is where Jason jumps the shark:

> With over a 90% market share, Apple is likely going to lose market share in the tablet game. The dominance is likely to end, but consumers will probably continue to keep picking the iPad over other tablets by a wide margin. The Apple halo effect is incredibly strong.

So how do we define "iPad dominance?" Is outselling competitors by a wide margin considered dominant? Out of one side of his mouth he states that the iPad's success is likely doomed and out of the other side he says it will continue to outsell other tablets by a wide margin. So which is it?
