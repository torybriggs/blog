A well-made promo video of Wacom's new Inkling. The product looks interesting, especially for someone who experiences a real disconnect when sketching on a tablet while looking up at a screen. After watching some of the getting started videos I have some reservations. In order for the pen to work you must maintain a clear line of sight with the receiver. This can be difficult during a sketch, especially for those that are constantly rotating/moving their drawing to get a good angle.

The Inkling is set to launch mid-September for $199.
