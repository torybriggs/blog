title: Make Room For Something New

Jason Fried put up a great piece about dropping existing products to make room for new ideas:

> But you also know that cutting things back means that you’ve favoring what’s left. You pick the winners, you help the tree grow up strong. And most importantly, while pruning gets rid of a lot, it also opens up new opportunities. Light gets in where it couldn’t before. Air circulates better. And new growth comes to life.

This concept can also apply to life. It's very easy to begin a myriad of new projects to make yourself feel busy and productive. If I'm working on something (anything!) I'm being productive, right?

It's important to step back and take inventory of those activities that our enriching our lives and those that aren't.
