It looks like someone finally made a decent "ultrabook" (hate that category name) laptop that doesn't look identical to the Macbook Air.

Joanna Stern:

> Boy, is it a nice change of pace to not open this paragraph — as I have the other ultrabook reviews — with a description of how the U300s looks like a MacBook Air with some slight tweaks. Not only has Lenovo taken a totally different design route than Apple (and subsequently Asus and Acer), but it’s created one of the most unique and beautiful machines in existence.

These product reviews from The Verge are top notch. Be sure to read the wrap-up and watch the video review.
