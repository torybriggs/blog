We were fortunate enough to upgrade my wife's old Blackberry Pearl to an iPhone 4S recently. To be frank, nearly any phone at the Verizon store would be an upgrade from the Pearl.

My wife does not always share my enthusiasm for new technology. Although she was excited to get a new phone, the Blackberry was familiar and switching made her a little apprehensive (and she loved a physical keyboard). She doesn't have a hard time learning new technology (she mastered OS X and a Canon 50D in record time), but a phone is a personal device in which you place a lot of trust. If you're not covering this stuff on a daily basis switching from one platform to another can take some getting used to.

With the iPhone 4S we were most excited about the camera. We have two daughters, a two-year old and a three-year old, and the advantages of having a great camera in a device you never leave home are enormous. You don't want to miss a single moment with those kids. In short, the camera is great and we've already captured some fun videos.

### Siri

The second most exciting thing (for me, at least) was Siri. As a gadget geek I couldn't wait to try it out. I had already read impressions from tech pundits across the web and seen plenty of videos, but Siri is something much more enjoyable in-person. From the outset I had my doubts as to how well it would actually work. And even more importantly, whether my wife would ever use a "voice command" system.

**It only took two examples before she was hooked**.

As soon as we had walked out of the store and entered the car I asked if I could show her how Siri worked. I immediately tried the first action I could remember from some of the reviews I had read - "Siri, please remind me to call my wife at 7 tonight" - after a moment the response and reminder eased into the screen and my wife's jaw dropped. I merely said "it gets better."

The second thing I tried was a calendar appointment - "Siri, please schedule a meeting to call the clinic about Brionni's next Chemo treatment tomorrow at noon" - again, and without missing a beat, Siri responded and the calendar appointment was scheduled ([Brionni](http://brionni.org) is our daughter). Again, my wife couldn't believe it. I handed back the iPhone so she could give it try. She tried a reminder first. It worked. She tried it again. It worked again. I could already see how this was going to change things.

Since our little demo in the car, my wife has used Siri to send me texts, call her mom and set up a gazillion reminders. It doesn't always work for her. At first she would get confused as to whether and when she needed to hit the microphone button but has since learned to just listen for "ready" and "acknowledgement" tones.

The key to all of this is trust and simplicity. If I had told her she would need to memorize a set of "keywords" to make all of this work, she would never use it. The psychological barrier of memorizing a set of words or phrases is too great for most. That's the magic of natural language recognition. You can say things in a variety of ways to accomplish the same task. Even when Siri can't help, she normally gives a useful answer. One of the first things I watched my wife try was (she loves to call Siri by name) "Siri, please call my mom" - Siri responded that she didn't know who her mom was and prompted her to add that association in her contacts.

It has been fascinating to watch. My wife has sent messages, set up reminders, scheduled appointments and even found her way to the DMV - all with her voice. When you watch it in action it's very easy to see how game changing Siri will be.
