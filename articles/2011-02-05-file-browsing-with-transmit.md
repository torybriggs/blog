I had never thought of [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit) as anything other than a tool for remote file management, but Chris Bowler makes a very intelligent observation:

>Because it has two panes, each of which can be used for local or remote locations, itâ€™s perfect for moving files from one folder to another. This is certainly faster than using 2 Finder windows.
