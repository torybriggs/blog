Writing does not always come easy for me. I'm easily distracted by the myriad of things possible at the computer and on the Internet. My brain throttles into overdrive as I attempt to get my thoughts through the keyboard and on the screen. As ideas come in I'm always tempted to tab out to Safari and quickly look something up. Oftentimes as soon as this happens, my concentration is broken and I fall down the internet rabbit hole. [Notational Velocity][2], in it's simplicity, has helped solve this problem.

 [Alex Payne] [1] has some great advice about using simple tools that are focused and do one thing extremely well.  NV is the epitome of this advice.  There are [versions of NV][3] that support [Markdown][4] as well as [Simplenote][5] syncing which makes the task of writing and publishing even easier.
 
I would hate to lose any of my writing due to a server failure or hard drive crash.  NV stores all of its text files in a small database which can be encrypted and offloaded to [Dropbox][6].  And automatic Simplenote syncing means that in the very moment you type a new word, it is saved in two offsite locations.

The first time I opened NV I was a little baffled at the interface.  There is almost nothing to see.  There are two panes set within one vertical window.  The top pane contains a list of all your notes and the bottom pane is the writing area.  At the very top is a search bar that serves two functions.  As you type in it, the first pane will automatically search and filter your list of notes.  This happens in the same manner as Google Instant.  If you push return after writing something in the bar a new note will be created and whatever you had in the search bar will be the title.  This means there is never any need for CMD-N or CMD-S.  New notes are created and saved automatically.

I can't recommend Notational Velocity enough.
