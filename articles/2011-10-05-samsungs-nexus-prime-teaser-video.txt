At the end of the video you catch the profile of a new phone from Samsung (Nexus Prime) with a curved screen. If you pause the video and look closely it seems there is a faint outline of a tablet behind the phone. This is pure speculation on my part, but it would go well with the theme of the video. Will Samsung announce a new phone *and* and a new tablet on October 11th? Only time will tell, but this could get interesting.
