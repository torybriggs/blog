There is some great dialogue coming from Marco and Nilay about the current state of patents. Marco has an intelligent response to Nilay's [editorial](http://thisismynext.com/2011/08/11/broken-patent-system/ "The patent system isn't broken - we are"), which extols some of the values of the current system. From what I can tell, the issue isn't necessarily with the current system but rather the practical enforcement of it. The system *can* work if you have the time and resources to navigate your way through the process.
