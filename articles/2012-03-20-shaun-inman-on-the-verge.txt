One of my favorite developers/designers, Shaun Inman, interviewd by Thomas
Houston on The Verge:

> **Q: Why are so many touch-based control systems so frustrating to use?**

> I think it's probably the lack of physical context. When you rest your hands on a physical keyboard you know when your fingers are misaligned or resting between rows or columns of keys without looking. Touch screen interfaces rely on manual visual alignment. Buttons on touch screens also lack the light resistance and satisfying snap you get from physical buttons. It's impossible to identify the state of an onscreen button by touch alone.
