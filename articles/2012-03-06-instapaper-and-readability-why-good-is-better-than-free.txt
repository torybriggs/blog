title: "Instapaper and Readability: Why Good is Better than Free"

[Instapaper](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8 "Instapaper") is one of my favorite iOS apps. It's the app I tell friends and family about whenever they buy an iOS device for the first time. Instapaper was created and is maintained by Marco Arment, an independent developer, [writer](http://www.marco.org/ "Marco Arment") and [podcaster](http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze "Build and Analyze"). With the release of [Readability](https://www.readability.com "Readability"), Marco suddenly finds himself competing with a free product that has a nearly identical feature-set.

When Readability was first announced, I was excited by the [promise](http://blog.readability.com/2011/01/the-new-readability/ "The New Readability"):

> The core motivator behind the new Readability is pretty straight-forward: good, quality content is worth paying for and we shouldn’t have to rely on any particular platform or device to do so. Readability represents an ambitious attempt to reconcile the freedom and speed of the web with the need to pay for content that is worth paying for.

However, with the launch of their new iOS app, this initial promise has been sent to the bottom of the feature list and is not even mentioned on their homepage. Don't get me wrong, the app is gorgeous and it works great, but apparently their conviction that "good, quality content is worth paying for" isn't so strong after all, especially since their app and service are now free.

The idea was that by paying a subscription fee you could contribute to any publisher who had signed up with Readability simply by saving and reading their content. While the idea seemed great on the surface, [it doesn't seem to be working in practice](http://brooksreview.net/2012/03/readability-ios/ "Readability for iOS by Ben Brooks"). There are also questions about the fate of unclaimed money that never makes it to publishers because they haven't opted in to Readability's service. Does Readability claim this money in the name of these publishers? Again, I defer to [Mr. Brooks](http://brooksreview.net/2011/11/readability-agency/):

> Now, realistically, I have given Readability consent by signing up — but what about other publishers that have not only not signed up, but have actively chosen to not sign up? Is it still OK for Readability to be collecting money in their name?

For some reason, this type of model rubs me the wrong way. I wish the folks at Arco90 would be a bit more transparent about their business model even though I honestly believe they have the best intentions.

In light of their desire to support publishers through subscriptions, it doesn't make a lot of sense that the service and app are free. How do they propose to support publishers if the majority of their users don't subscribe to the service anymore? I think the intitial idea about being a paid service and in turn paying publishers [didn't exactly pan out](http://blog.readability.com/2011/02/an-open-letter-to-apple/ "An Open Letter To Apple"), and they were forced to enter a model that competes directly with Instapaper. The only real difference between the two products is that Instapaper will set you back $4.99.

In my humble opinion, I would rather pay someone for their hard work. It is the same reason I use [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in "Pinboard") and pay for a [shawnblanc.net membership](http://shawnblanc.net/members/ "Shawn Blanc Membership"). It feels good to support the people who's sites I read or tools I use. I don't know how Readability will make money in the long run. If they are marketing to a crowd that only prefers free apps, I think they will have a difficult time convincing them to pay for an optional subscription that is now seen as a secondary or tertiary feature.

Marco has been [very open](http://www.marco.org/2011/11/16/readability "The relationship between Readability and Instapaper") about his history with the Readability folks. It seems like an intial well-intentioned idea didn't work out and the former partners are now direct competitors. Competition is good and I think Instapaper will be better because of it. But in a software battle of attrition, the software that [actually generates revenue](http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/ "Don't be a free user") will be the likely victor.
