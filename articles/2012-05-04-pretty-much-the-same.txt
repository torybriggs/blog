title: Pretty much the same
date: 04/05/2012

Near the bottom of the features page for [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com "RubyMotion") (emphasis mine):

> RubyMotion is 100% compliant with Apple's App Store policies. Your code is compiled ahead-of-time, never interpreted, and you access the entire set of iOS public APIs.

> **At the end, a RubyMotion app looks pretty much the same as an Objective-C app**.

As someone who spends most of his workday in Ruby, the idea behind RubyMotion is incredibly appealing, but the phrase "pretty much the same" has me a little concerned. The bar has been set high for quality iOS apps and performance features such as 60fps scrolling and responsive animations are standard. It will be hard to justify the $149 price tag until I see some real world examples of a complex RubyMotion app meeting these high standards.
