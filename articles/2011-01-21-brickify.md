A service from the [Carsonified](http://www.carsonified.com/) team that transforms any uploaded graphic/image into blocks. Imagine your designs being built with legos, that's basically what the service accomplishes.  You can take a look at the source over on [Github](https://github.com/carsonified/brickify)
