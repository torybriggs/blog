Larry Page commenting on the job performance of Eric:
>Eric has clearly done an outstanding job leading Google for the last decade. The results speak for themselves. There is no other CEO in the world that could have kept such headstrong founders so deeply involved and still run the business so brilliantly.

Google reported a Q4 revenue of $8.44 billion which was a increase in 26% compared to 2009. Not too shabby.

This is a fairly dramatic change in management as Schmidt will now be relegated to "technology thought leadership." Will Larry stepping in to manage day-to-day operations spell a change in direction for the company? Only time will tell.
