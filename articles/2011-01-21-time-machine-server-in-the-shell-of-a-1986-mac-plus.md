Dean Gray on his creation:
>Using the shell of a 1986 Mac Plus 1MB – I filled the innards with 6 hard drives (2.3TB total) and an intel atom motherboard,” says Dean. “This is now my time machine server. I didn’t have space for the screen so it’s got a 10.4″ digital picture frame to replace that, but i’ve got VGA out to a monitor for when I need to see it. It’s getting WiFi soon as well. Not actually difficult to do, surprisingly.
