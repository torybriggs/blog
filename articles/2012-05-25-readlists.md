So, I made my first [Readlist](http://readlists.com/502966cc/ "All of Anil Dash's best work"). It's all the best things [Anil Dash](http://dashes.com/anil/ "Anil Dash") has written dating back to 1999. It's pretty epic. There are over 100 articles in this list. I have no doubt Anil spent countless hours writing, editing and publishing to produce such a large body of work. And now, thanks to [Readlists](http://readlists.com "Readlists"), you can download/read/share every article without every visiting Anil's site. Isn't that cool?

I see a future in which we will never have to patronize our favorite writer's sites. We'll simply create Readlists, re-package and download the content and enjoy it forever. We'll never have to see a pesky ad or rss sponsorship again. If [publishers ask to opt-out](http://brooksreview.net/2012/05/readlists-lies/ "Ben Brooks wants to opt out, but can't."), we can count on Arc90 to ignore them.

The future is here, deal with it.

(To make things even easier, you can [download the epub directly](http://readlists.com/502966cc/download/epub "Anil Dash'es best work, straight to your hardrive"), courtesy of Readlists)
