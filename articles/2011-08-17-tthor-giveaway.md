As some of you may know, I started a newsletter about a month ago. The goal was to compile all the great things I found throughout the week and send it to everyone interested. There are so many great things published online every week and it is impossible to consume it all. I felt a newsletter would be an intimate and fun way way to deliver some of the best content of the week, and it's apparent I wasn't the only one.

It has been an explosive week for [TThor](http://tthor.com "TThor") (thanks [Shawn](http://shawnblanc.net/2011/08/tthor/ "shawnblanc.net")) and I wanted to do something to thank all of the subscribers, both new and old. I'm preparing a fun giveaway in this week's edition of TThor which will involve participation by the community. The exact details of the contest will be in this week's edition, but in the meantime, thanks for all the support.

**Update**: TThor has secured it's first sponsor! [Code School](http://www.codeschool.com "Code School") will be offering something special for readers in the upcoming issue.
