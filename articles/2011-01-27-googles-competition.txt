According to Eric Schmidt it's not Facebook. From Engadget:

>[Eric] was in Davos this week, and he had some choice words for reporters on Google's competition -- and it's not Facebook. "Microsoft has more cash, more engineers, more global reach. We see competition from Microsoft every day," says Eric, while Facebook "has clearly stated they don't want to get into the search business. Facebook users tend to use Google search."

I think Eric is downplaying the influence of Facebook. It's true Microsoft is a much larger player and competes on more levels than Facebook but this near dismissal of the behemoth social network is interesting.

Also interesting is Eric's comment with regards to Apple. Nilay:

>As for Apple, he gave the usual line about both partnering with and competing with Cupertino, while taking a moment to laud Steve Jobs as "the most successful CEO in the world anywhere," who's built an "elegant, scalable, closed system" while "Google is attempting to do something with a completely different approach."

There is much more respect for Apple from the former Google CEO than there is for Facebook, but he still couldn't help playing the "closed" card.
